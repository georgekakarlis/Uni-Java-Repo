        // most floating point numbers are only aproximately correct. Some numbers,
        //like reasonably sized integers, can be represented exactly. But repeating fractions, like 1/3, and 
        // irrational numbers like Ï€, cannot. To represent these numbers, computers have to round off to the nearest floating-point number. 
        //The different between the number we want and the floating-point number we get is called rounding error, eg :
        
        System.out.println(0.1 * 10);
        System.out.println(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1);

        // but on many machines the output is : 
        // 1.0
        // 0.99999999999999

        // rounding errors are not useful in situations like computers graphics, encryption etc where we need precision 
        // in our data types. thats when we use int instead of float
