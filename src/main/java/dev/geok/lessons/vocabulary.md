variable : a named storage location for values. all variables have a type, which is declared when the variable is created.
value: A number, string, or other data that can be stored in a variable. Every
value belongs to a type (e.g., int or String).
type: Mathematically speaking, a set of values. The type of a variable deter-
mines which values it can have.
declaration: A statement that creates a new variable and specifies its type.
keyword: A reserved word used by the compiler to analyze programs. You
cannot use keywords (like public, class, and void) as variable names.
assignment: A statement that gives a value to a variable.
initialize: To assign a variable for the first time.
state: The variables in a program and their current values.
memory diagram: A graphical representation of the state of a program at
a point in time.
operator: A symbol that represents a computation like addition, multiplica-
tion, or string concatenation.
operand: One of the values on which an operator operates. Most operators
in Java require two operands.
expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that repre-
sents a single value. Expressions also have types, as determined by their
operators and operands.

oating-point: A data type that represents numbers with an integer part
and a fractional part. In Java, the default 
oating-point type is double.
rounding error: The difference between the number we want to represent
and the nearest 
oating-point number.
concatenate: To join two values, often strings, end to end.
order of operations: The rules that determine in what order expressions are
evaluated. Also known as \operator precedence".
compile-time error: An error in the source code that makes it impossible
to compile. Also called a \syntax error".
2.12 Exercises 31
parse: To analyze the structure of a program; what the compiler does first.
run-time error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to run to
completion. Also called an \exception".
logic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than
what the programmer intended.
